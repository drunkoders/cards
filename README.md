# Cards - UI

![Build status](https://github.com/drunkoders/cards-ui/workflows/main/badge.svg)

This repository contains the UI for the Cards project.
It was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

- Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file and setting the values you need.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
